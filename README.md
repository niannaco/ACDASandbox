# ACDASandbox
This repository is a reimplementation of the paper "Adaptive Convolutions with Per-pixel Dynamic Filter Atom" ([ACDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07895.pdf))

## Usage
Run main.py to train Ad-ResNet-s on CIFAR-100
Model classes with ACDA layers contain test functions to summarize the network architecture
